# NuclearCraft Steam Additions
More useful steamy stuff for early and late game.

Basically this mod was created as replacement for GT as Steam Era implementation in my mod-pack.

This stuff will be useful at the early play before player gets RF machines and late game when you have High-Pressure steam from the NC reactor which opens you some new recipes
