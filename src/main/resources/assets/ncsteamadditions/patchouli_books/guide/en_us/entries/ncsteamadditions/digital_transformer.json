      "text": "Digital Transformer is not a typical machine. It gives you a great opportunity to use cool recipes but you have to manage it's Efficiency. How to do that? Not that hard. Plug a computer to it and do some coding magic. In the script you write you need to keep Efficiency as high as possible. You can reach that by adjusting Reactivity. Digital transformer has 2 hidden parameters."

Track efficiency by calling digital_transformer.getRecipeEfficiency() and digital_transformer.getRecipeProgress(). Keep in mind, Current Reactivity is not changing permanently after adjustments."
